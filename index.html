    <h1>Halloween Costume Tutorial</h1>

    <h3>
      Hi there! In this tutorial you will learn how to have the coolest costume
      ever using a few basic steps!
    </h3>
    <p class="step">
      Step 1:
    </p>
    <p>
      Pick a theme (you can have a family theme or just one for yourself) For
      example: Harry Potter
    </p>
    <p class="step">
      Step 2:
    </p>
    <p>
      Plan out what you have to do (decide how much sewing you're going to do,
      crafting you have to do, etc.)
    </p>
    <p class="step">
      Step 3:
    </p>
    <p>
      Collect all your materials (head to Goodwill and Hobby Lobby for a wide
      selection of craft supplies and clothes that can be converted and sewn to
      match your character!)
    </p>
    <p class="step">
      Step 4:
    </p>
    <p>
      Consult with an expert (not everybody knows how to sew or craft; ask your
      parents, your grandma, or even your best friend for help with the things
      you don't know how to do)
    </p>
    <p class="step">
      Step 5:
    </p>
    <p>
      Start to put it together (pull out your hot glue gun and sewing machine -
      it's time to create!)
    </p>
    <p class="step">
      Step 6:
    </p>
    <p>
      SPOILER ALERT: Your first ever costume will not *I REPEAT* will NOT be as
      good as you want it to, but don't let that get you down. Make your
      costume, wear it trick or treating, and next year's will be even cooler!
    </p>
